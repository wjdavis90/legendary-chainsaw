# Estimating divergence times with SNAPP
**Purpose**: This section (and subsections) describes how SNPs were used to build species trees  and estimate divergence times within the genus *Perdix* with SNAPP.

**Procedure**: Filter a VCF file of SNP data

**Input**: a SNP VCF file

**Output**: a filtered VCF file & phylogeny with divergence estimates
